# How to Add Sync Hub Logo

## Steps:

1. **Save the logo image**
   - Save your "S" logo image as `logo.png`
   - Make sure it has a transparent or white background
   - Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or higher (will be scaled down)

2. **Place the logo file**
   - Copy `logo.png` to the `public/` folder
   - The path should be: `public/logo.png`

3. **Done!**
   - The logo will automatically appear in the header
   - The name is already changed to "Sync Hub"

## Current Status:
- ✅ Name changed from "Company Hub" to "Sync Hub" in the header
- ⏳ Waiting for you to add `logo.png` to the `public/` folder

The header component is already set up to display the logo at `/logo.png`.
